ROTATE-ARRAY

=> Checked the length of the array(n).
=> If K is bigger than n , I used K% n so that the rotation does not go extra.
=> I made a new list with the same size to store the rotated numbers.
=> For every number in the original array , I calculated its new position using (i+k)%n.
=> then I placed the number into that new position .
=> At the end the new list is the rotated array.
=> This method is simple and easy to understand with loops.
