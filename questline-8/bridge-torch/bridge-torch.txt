We have 4 people who need to cross the narrow bridge

Person A = 1 minute , Person B = 2 minutes , Person C = 7 minutes , Person D = 10 minutes . 
Only 2 people can cross at once, and they must walk at the slower personâ€™s speed. The torch must always be carried. 

=> A and B go first :
      Time taken = 2 minutes  . Now A and B are on the other side.

=> A comes back with torch :
      Time taken = 1 minute . Now A, C, D on the start side; B is waiting on the other side.

=> C and D cross together :
      Time taken = 10 minutes . Now C and D are on the other side with B , only A left behind .

=> B comes back with torch:
      Time taken = 2 minutes . Now A and B are on start side; C and D are on other side.

=> A and B cross again:
      Time taken = 2 minutes . Finally, all 4 are on the other side. And crossed the bridge .
      
ACCORDING TO ME B COMES BACK WITH TOURCH . [BASICALLY THIS IS MY APPROXIMATION & THOUGHTS]


TOTLA TIME : 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes [APPROX]
